# Practice_assignments

Under each exercise folder there is solutions.php file, each with 3 solved problems.

## Usage 

To test locally in command line, there are commented lines after each problem for simple input testing.

Uncomment those lines and replace them with custom inputs.

## TODO

Some problems should be solved more efficiently, but currently they are solved to the best of my abbilites.
